The ***purpose*** of this project is to simulate simple gravitational interactions in a manner that is both visually and 
cognitively stimulating.  My hopes are that this project will serve as a catalyst for interest in orbital dynamics and 
the cosmos within the user. The initial implementation will allow a user to create and modify orbital systems, observe 
system evolution over time, and save their creations for later use. 

The ***inspiration*** behind this project materializes out of my own love for physics and the universe.  I present this
program for both the layperson and physics enthusiast alike.  I intend the user experience to be simple, rewarding, and 
engaging, while accommodating those who wish to monitor more advanced parameters.

### User stories

A first iteration:
- As a user, I want to be able to observe solar system evolution over time.
- As a user, I want to be able to add known planets to a solar system
- As a user, I want to be able to define initial orbital parameters for a custom planet upon creation
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of current planets in the solar system and their orbital parameters
